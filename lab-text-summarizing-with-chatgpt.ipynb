I tried general summarization, department-focused summaries (shipping and pricing), and then created three new variations: sentiment extraction, customer persona guessing, and actionable feedback.\n",
    "\n",
    "Findings from the prompts:\n",
    "\n",
    "The general summaries worked very well. GPT produced short, clear summaries that captured the main idea without much fluff.\n",
    "\n",
    "When I asked for shipping-focused summaries, the model usually picked out the delivery information (like fast shipping or missing parts). However, sometimes it added unrelated product details even though I asked only about shipping.\n",
    "\n",
    "The pricing-focused summaries were also useful, but GPT occasionally overemphasized price concerns even if they were just briefly mentioned in the review.\n",
    "\n",
    "The sentiment extraction prompt mostly worked, labeling reviews as positive, neutral, or negative. Still, it sometimes simplified mixed reviews into one category, even when the review had both pros and cons.\n",
    "\n",
    "The customer persona guessing prompt was interesting but less reliable. GPT tried to “imagine” who the reviewer was, and sometimes it made up details that weren’t in the text (like guessing eco-friendliness or budget concerns when they weren’t mentioned).\n",
    "\n",
    "The actionable feedback prompt was one of the most helpful. GPT gave concrete suggestions like “offer larger size options” or “adjust the price.” These could actually be passed on to a business team.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall observations:\n",
    "\n",
    "GPT is excellent at summarization when the instructions are clear and specific.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the prompts are too broad, GPT tends to hallucinate or include extra details.\n",
    "\n",
    "Adding clear constraints (like “limit to 20 words” or “focus only on shipping”) improves reliability, though sometimes GPT still stretches the scope.\n",
    "\n",
    "More creative prompts (like persona guessing) are fun, but they show the limits of the model since it can invent things.\n",
    "\n",
    "What I learned:\n",
    "This activity showed me how much the prompt wording matters. Small changes in phrasing can lead to very different outputs. I also learned that GPT is best when summarizing or rephrasing existing information, but less trustworthy when asked to infer things that aren’t clearly in the text. Finally, I saw that GPT can be more than just a summarizer it can generate structured feedback, recommendations, or even simulate a \"persona\" but the accuracy depends heavily on how the prompt is designed."
